# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your sample apps and patches! Before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an
    [individual CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a
    [corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.

## Contributing A Patch

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
1. The repo owner will respond to your issue promptly.
1. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the sample to which you are contributing.
1. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
1. Submit a pull request!

### How to run the tests

1. You must install dependencies at the root of the `nodejs-docs-samples`
directory. You can do so with `yarn` or `npm`:

        npm install

    or

        yarn install

    **Note:** Use `npm` *or* `yarn` exclusively, don't mix them.

1. In a terminal, start Redis:

        redis-server

1. In another terminal, start `memcached`:

        memcached

1. In another terminal, run the unit tests from the root of the project:

        npm test

    or

        yarn test

    With code coverage:

        npm run cover

    or

        yarn run cover

1. Then run the system tests from the root of the project:

        npm run system-test

    or

        yarn run system-test

    With code coverage:

        npm run system-cover

    or

        yarn run system-cover

1. Or run all the tests at once:

        npm run all-test

    or

        yarn run all-test

    With code coverage:

        npm run all-cover

    or

        yarn run all-cover

### Run the tests for a single sample

1. You must install dependencies at the root of the `nodejs-docs-samples`
directory. You can do so with `yarn` or `npm`:

        npm install

    or

        yarn install

1. Change directory to one of the sample folders, e.g. `bigquery`:

        cd bigquery/

1. Run the tests (check the `package.json` file):

        npm test

    or

        yarn test

    or

        npm run system-test

    or

        yarn run system-test

## Style

Samples in this repository follow the [JavaScript Semi-Standard
Style](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard).

You can run `npm run lint` to match our JavaScript coding standards.
