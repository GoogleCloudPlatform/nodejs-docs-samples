# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

This repository contains samples that the documentation on [Google Cloud Platform ][cloud] references. Samples for a client library should be added to the client repository, not this repository. (For example, the `functions` folder is reserved for samples used in [cloud.google.com/functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)). If you wrote a great sample but it is not used in Google's official documentation, there are better suited places to publish it such as a [community tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/community/).

## Run the tests for a single sample

1. Obtain authentication credentials. Depending on the sample, you
need to enable the appropriate APIs in the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).

        gcloud auth application-default login

1. Change directory to one of the sample folders, e.g. `datastore`.

        cd datastore/

1. Install the dependencies.

        npm install

1. Run the tests.

        npm test


## Adding new samples

All samples must have tests. We use `mocha` as testing framework. The package.json file within your sample directory must contain a test script that executes the `mocha` tests via `npm test` ([example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/blob/main/batch/package.json#L13)).

For new samples, a GitHub Actions workflow should be created to run your tests on the CI system:

1. Add an entry to [.github/workflows/workflows.json](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/blob/main/.github/workflows/workflows.json) matching the directory with your sample code.

1. From the root of the repo, generate a new workflow in the [workflows](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/blob/main/.github/workflows) directory. You can specify a `path` to only generate the specific workflow, e.g. `cloud-tasks`. If the path is omitted, all workflows will be generated.

        node .github/workflows/generate.js [path]

> **Note**
> There are some existing samples that use an alternative CI system. It is recommended to use GitHub Actions for new samples, but these instructions are provided below for your reference.
> 
> Add a **build configuration file (`.cfg`)** for your samples in **[`.kokoro/`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/tree/main/.kokoro)**. Check existing config files for the right format.
> 
> All tests need a corresponding job file outside of GitHub. If you are a Googler, please provide the CL alongside your PR. See the internal codelab for Kokoro for details. If you don't work at Google, the person reviewing your PR will create the job config for you.


### TypeScript Support

This repository also supports TypeScript samples. We use the [typeless-sample-bot](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-node/tree/main/packages/typeless-sample-bot) to convert TypeScript samples to pure JavaScript, which avoids having to maintain both TypeScript and JavaScript variants.

If you choose to write a TypeScript based sample, please follow these guidelines:

* **Testing**: Use a `.ts` test runner, which is executed by the `npm test` command `mocha --require ts-node/register test/*.ts` in `package.json`. **Do not** check in any generated `.js` tests from running `npm build`.
* **Imports** Use an `import` statement at the beginning of the file to enable importing types. Within each "region tag," import required libraries with `required`. Each of these region tag sections are directly embedded in the Cloud documentation, so the imports help show our users which libraries are needed.
* **Linting** See the example [.eslintrc.yml](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/tree/main/scheduler/.eslintrc.yml).
* **JavaScript** Do not modify any `.js` files. The [typeless-sample-bot](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-node/tree/main/packages/typeless-sample-bot) will overwrite them as it converts from TypeScript into JavaScript.
* **package.json**: See a full set of npm targets in the scheduler [package.json](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/tree/main/scheduler/package.json). Include any relevant `@types` in your `devDependencies` section. 
* **tsconfig.json**:
  * Include a [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) in the root of your sample directory.
  * You can find a minimal example [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/tree/main/scheduler/tsconfig.json).
  * It is recommended to set `noImplicitAny` to `false`, but it may be needed to set this to `true` if you haven't fully migrated the sample to TypeScript.
  * Add an `excludes` entry with your test files to avoid building `*.js` versions.

You can look at the [scheduler](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/tree/main/scheduler) sample directory for an example of a TypeScript sample and its matching test runner.

### Style

The [Google Cloud Samples Style Guide][style-guide] is considered the primary
guidelines for all Google Cloud samples. 

[style-guide]: https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/samples-style-guide/

Samples in this repository also follow the JavaScript coding standards. See instructions below to run the linter to match our JavaScript coding standards:

1. Install dependencies at the root of the `nodejs-docs-samples`
directory.

        npm install

1. Run the linter for all samples, including the ones you're adding.

        npm run lint

## Failing CI
`Required` tests need to pass. Tests that are not required are expected to fail, they are usually work in progress.
