# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

This repository contains samples that the documentation on [Google Cloud Platform ][cloud] references. Samples for a client library should be added to the client repository, not this repository. (For example, the `functions` folder is reserved for samples used in [cloud.google.com/functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)). If you wrote a great sample but it is not used in Google's official documentation, there are better suited places to publish it such as a [community tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/community/).

## Run the tests for a single sample

1. Obtain authentication credentials. Depending on the sample, you
need to enable the appropriate APIs in the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).

        gcloud auth application-default login

1. Change directory to one of the sample folders, e.g. `datastore`.

        cd datastore/

1. Install the dependencies.

        npm install

1. Run the tests.

        npm test


## Adding new samples

All samples must have tests. We use `mocha` as testing framework.

Add a **build configuration file (`.cfg`)** for your samples in **[`.kokoro/`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/tree/main/.kokoro)**. Check existing config files for the right format.

All tests need a corresponding job file outside of GitHub. If you are a Googler, please provide the CL alongside your PR. See the internal codelab for Kokoro for details. If you don't work at Google, the person reviewing your PR will create the job config for you.

### Style

The [Google Cloud Samples Style Guide][style-guide] is considered the primary
guidelines for all Google Cloud samples. 

[style-guide]: https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/samples-style-guide/

Samples in this repository also follow the JavaScript coding standards. See instructions below to run the linter to match our JavaScript coding standards:

1. Install dependencies at the root of the `nodejs-docs-samples`
directory.

        npm install

1. Run the linter for all samples, including the ones you're adding.

        npm run lint

## Failing CI
`Required` tests need to pass. Tests that are not required are expected to fail, they are usually work in progress.
