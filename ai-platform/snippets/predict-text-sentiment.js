    unfortunately I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors \
    deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all \
    medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the \
    shots) were absolutely terrible. I watched this over my spring break and it is \
    very safe to say that I feel that I was gypped out of 114 minutes of my \
    vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.

    Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It was not \
    the same old recycled crap that comes out of Hollywood every month. I saw this \
    movie on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it at my \
    local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not \
    regret it.

    My family has watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the movie first \
    came out. We have most lines memorized. I watched it two weeks ago and still \
    get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life. \
    This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene \
    is when Arthur is visiting his fiancÃ©e's house. His conversation with the \
    butler and Susan's father is side-spitting. The line from the butler, \
    "Would you care to wait in the Library" followed by Arthur's reply, \
    "Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question", is my NEWMAIL \
    notification on my computer.
