# Grunt -> Google App Engine

This is a simple guide to using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) with Google App Engine. 

1. Follow the [grunt getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) to get up and runnning. 

2. Create an `app.yaml` in the root of your application with the following contents:

	```yaml
	runtime: nodejs
	vm: true
	api_version: 1
	env_variables:
  		PORT: 8080
	```

3. Run `npm install --save-dev grunt-cli` to make the Grunt command line tools available locally during the build. 

4. Modify your `package.json` to include an npm `postinstall` script.  This will be run during your applications `npm install` phase. For convenience, you can use an npm script to deploy as well:

	```js
	"scripts": {
	  "start": "node ./src/bin/www",
	  "postinstall": "./node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt build",
	  "deploy": "gcloud preview app deploy app.yaml --set-default --project gruntjs-demo",
	  "browse": "open http://gruntjs-demo.appspot.com"
	},
	```

	At the terminal you can now run `npm run deploy` to deploy your application.
