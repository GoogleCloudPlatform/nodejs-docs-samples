# Memcached sample for Google App Engine

**Note: This sample uses the older `vm: true` configuration. It will be upgraded
to use the newer `env: flex` configuration when `env: flex` fully supports
Memcached.**

This sample demonstrates accessing Memcached from Node.js on
[Google App Engine Flexible Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

## Running locally

Refer to the [appengine/README.md](../README.md) file for instructions on
running and deploying.
