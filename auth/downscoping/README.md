This section contains samples for
[Downscoping with Credential Access Boundaries](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/downscoping-short-lived-credentials).

## Running the samples

1. Your environment must be setup with [authentication
information](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#howtheywork). If you're running on Cloud Shell or Compute Engine, this is already setup. You can also use `gcloud auth application-default login`.

2. Install dependencies from `package.json`

        $ npm install

3. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` to the project ID.

4. The test will created storage bucket and file with name generated by [UUID][https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid] in the project ID set above.

5. To run the tests, the application default credentials principal should have the ability to create and delete a Cloud Storage bucket:

        $ npm run test
