## Setup

Before you can run or deploy the sample, you need to do the following (where
appropriate, replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with the ID of your Cloud project):

1.  Refer to the [appengine/README.md][readme] file for instructions on
    running and deploying.

1. Set the `GCLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable:

    Linux:

        export GCLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id

    Windows:

        set GCLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id

    Windows (PowerShell):

        $env:GCLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"

1.  Acquire local credentials for authenticating with Google Cloud Platform APIs:

        gcloud auth application-default login

1.  Configure git to use gcloud SDK:

        git config credential.helper gcloud.sh

1.  Add your Cloud Source Repository as a git remote:

        git remote add google https://source.developers.google.com/p/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/r/default

1.  Commit and push the code into the Cloud Source Repository:

        git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit" && git push --all google

1.  Install dependencies:

    With `npm`:

        npm install

    or with `yarn`:

        yarn install

## Running locally

With `npm`:

    npm start

or with `yarn`:

    yarn start

## Deploying to App Engine

With `npm`:

    npm run deploy

or with `yarn`:

    yarn run deploy

Use the [Stackdriver Debugger dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/debug) to inspect runtime data of the app.
