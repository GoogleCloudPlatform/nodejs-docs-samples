**Step 2: Sauté the Meat**

Heat the olive oil in your paella pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and optional rabbit/pork. Season with salt and pepper. Brown the meat well on all sides, ensuring it's cooked through. This browning adds a lot of flavor to your paella. Once browned, push the meat to the sides of the pan.

**Step 3: Add Vegetables**

Add the green beans and lima beans to the center of the pan. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes until they start to soften. Then, add the grated tomato and paprika. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomato breaks down and the mixture is fragrant.
