# Google Cloud Key Management Service Node.js Samples

[![Build](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-docs-samples-badges/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/nodejs-docs-samples-kms.svg)]()

[Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/) allows you to keep encryption keys in one central cloud service, for direct use by other cloud resources and applications. With Cloud KMS you are the ultimate custodian of your data, you can manage encryption in the cloud the same way you do on-premises, and you have a provable and monitorable root of trust over your data.
