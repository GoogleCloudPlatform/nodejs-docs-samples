# Google Cloud Resource Manager API Node.js Samples

Google Cloud Platform provides container resources such as Organizations and
Projects, that allow you to group and hierarchically organize other Cloud
Platform resources. This hierarchical organization lets you easily manage common
aspects of your resources such as access control and configuration settings. The
[Google Cloud Resource Manager API][resource_docs] enables you to
programmatically manage these container resources.
